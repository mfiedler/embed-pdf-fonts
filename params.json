{"name":"Embed-pdf-fonts","tagline":"Embed fonts referenced in a PDF file, respecting Fontconfig substitutions","body":"# Description\r\n\r\n`embed-pdf-fonts` embeds fonts referenced from a PDF document as a font\r\nsubset, respecting [Fontconfig](http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fontconfig/) font substitution settings.\r\n\r\nIf all fonts referenced from a PDF file are embedded, the display quality of\r\nthe document will not depend on the availability of the used fonts at the\r\nviewer's computer any more.  Moreover, Fontconfig settings such as font\r\nsubstitutions are respected during processing.  This way, fonts that are not\r\navailable on a system and cause display problems for an existing PDF document\r\ncan be replaced so the problem does not occur any more on other systems\r\nmissing the referenced fonts, too.  If a font is fully embedded in the input\r\nPDF, it will be reduced to the subset of used symbols, reducing file size.\r\n\r\nNote: It is also possible to use Cairo tools for this purpuse (`pdftocairo`).\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\n    embed-pdf-fonts input.pdf output.pdf\r\n\r\n# Dependencies\r\n\r\n-   [Cairo](http://cairographics.org/)\r\n-   [Poppler](http://poppler.freedesktop.org/)\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\n    make\r\n    sudo make install\r\n\r\n# License\r\n\r\nThis project is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License\r\nversion 3 or later.
